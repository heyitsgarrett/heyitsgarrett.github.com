I wish I were a better writer, because then I could write about the dog I watched die in the middle of the road, the same day I should have been attending the funeral of a friend’s father but wasn’t. I could write about my fear of death, felt through my hand on a quivering dog, felt as I watched my friend grieve silently. I could write about my dad’s stroke a week later. The fear of the fallout, the guilt of the unsaid, the waiting to hear that he’s okay, that he’s as strong as he’s always been. He’s fine, no more alcohol, no more stress, but he’s fine. This was a warning shot.

I wish I were a better writer because then I could write about what my mom discovered. What she didn’t tell my brother and I, not yet, because she didn’t want to ruin our camping trip. She waited a week, let us live a little bit longer in a place where we weren’t worried about our family being torn apart.

My dad isn’t dead. But my mom is left alone in an empty house, widowed. I wish I were a better writer. There was no warning shot.
