<p>After five years, I’m moving on from the energy efficiency world. I joined <a href="http://www.opower.com">Opower</a> when it was a fledgling start-up in a small sub-leased office. I worked long hours with some incredible people on some absolutely incredible problems.</p>

<p>I saw the company grow from 15 people to 300 and our office expand again and again through the walls of neighboring space. I built (and re-built) a web application, developed print reports that were delivered to millions of homes, collaborated with Facebook, built a LEGO tower, and <a href="/images/blog/awyisss.jpg">met the President</a>.</p>

<p>It was an amazing experience - I can’t thank Dan, Alex, and my many, many talented coworkers enough for pushing me to put out the best work possible.</p>

<p>I’m going to be getting back to the startup grit with <a href="http://mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>, where I’ll be working with some other very smart folks on design, code, and business development. I can’t wait to get started.</p>
