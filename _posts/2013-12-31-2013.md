# Work

After five years with [Opower](http://opower.com), I [left the company](http://heyitsgarrett.com/posts/onwards/) and got back into the smaller startup fray with [Mapbox](http://www.mapbox.com) where I [built my first mobile app](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/meattext-redesigned/), designed [satellite-tasking interfaces](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/faxing-outer-space/), sneezed out [my first api](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/making-maki-better/), [got my toes drenched](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/pinterest-scaling-beautiful-maps/) in business development, and wrote code [at the White House](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/05/civic-hacking-white-house-we-people-people).

In the time there, I've learned an incredible amount about how I like to work and how effective a flat organization can be given the right people. Next year is going to be a blockbuster year for the company.

# Play

I saw many of my best friends get married this year in Miami, New York City, San Francisco and Richmond. Tick-tock!

Between jobs, I took a spontaneous trip to St John in the US Virgin Islands to visit a friend and for the most part, drink rum, build beach fires, and jump off cliffs.

In May, I completed a running goal I've had for some time now - several friends and I flew to Arizona to [run across the Grand Canyon and back](https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/heyitsgarrett.gk8h41gn/page.html?secure=1#11/36.1739/-112.0341). Starting from the South Rim at 4am, we returned 14 hours later after 52 miles and 12,500 feet of elevation gain. I could write a lot about that run but in short â€“ it was an incredible day.

Later in the fall, six of us got together again and ran from Cumberland, MD to Washington, DC as part of the [Ragnar Relay Ultra](http://ragnarrelay.com/race/dc/legs). It took us about 26  hours and we were deliriously sleep-deprived by the end. The highlight for me, however, was running the segment through my hometown of Barnesville, watching the sun rise over the corn fields at 7am.

Georgia and I [flew to Portland](http://instagram.com/p/eOVLamw1bY/) a week before [XOXO](http://instagram.com/p/em44j4Q1aP/) so that we could spend some time in the woods and attempt to summit our first mountain, Mt Adams. We got close, but had to abandon plans to summit due to rare lightning storms and bummer conditions at the top. We plan to try again, although we're setting our sights at some even higher peaks.

I also spent most of the summer [on my bike](http://instagram.com/p/duP77qw1Ut/), including many trips to my parents' farm and back.

# Side projects

While I put together a rather hefty redesign of [Doodle or Die](http://doodleordie.com) early in the year, I haven't contributed much code since then. The game [continues](http://doodleordie.com/explore), mainly in the hands of the micro-communities within the site, which is kind of sweet in its own right.

My other biggest contribution to the internet sphere this year was [LOUDGIF](http://loudgif.com/popular), a silly single page site that hacks together gifs and YouTube songs. The [results](http://a.loudgif.com/15nckKd) [speak](http://a.loudgif.com/130SPg0) [for](http://a.loudgif.com/10NN57R) [themselves](http://a.loudgif.com/12ZJXEv).

I also time-boxed myself 20 minutes to build [this dumb doge thing](http://heyitsgarrett.com/wow). I'm sorry for that one.
