            <p>
                I grew up in rural Maryland during the final analog years, helping raise animals and making cash on the
                weekends tending to farms nearby. The plan was to keep doing this until college, but I discovered the
                web.</p>

            <p>I got pretty good with Photoshop and started working after school for a web development company, <a

                learned to code. We
                built mailing list
                software and early online web store infrastructure for non-profits like the <a
                    href="https://aclu.org/">ACLU</a>
                and <a href="https://defenders.org">Defenders of Wildlife</a>. In 2003, the company was acquired by <a
                    href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kintera">Kintera</a>, which was bought five years
                later by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blackbaud">Blackbaud</a>, which will probably
                get bought by someone else down the road.</p>

                internet to send us art in the mail, with the promise to scan and share every piece we received. Over
                two years, we
                received 1,500 submissions from 30 countries and shared them all online. It was even the Yahoo site of

            <blockquote>
                In 2005 two senior studio majors created "The Envelope Collective," a project that collected and scanned
                decorated envelopes from contributors around the world. Neither artist was aware at the time of the
                Oberlin
                Library Mail Art Collection, nor of the mail art movement in general.

            <p>Moonlighting after-hours at Opower, I worked on a game called <a href="/projects/doodle-or-die"

                concept is
                probably familiar -- it's like the game of telephone, but with a drawing round every other turn. At its
                peak, we had over
                3 million players creating millions of drawings a month. It was so much fun to work on this game.
            </p>


            <p>I also had a few smaller creative projects, notably <a href="/projects/windoodles">Windoodles</a> and <a
                    href="/projects/imaginawesome">Imaginawesome</a>. All were cute and
                whimsical, back when the internet was still the right size for those kinds of things.</p>

            <p>After it received organizational support, I led the Slack Kit team, overseeing engineering and product
                direction. It was combined with Slack's
                Accessibility effort into the Product Systems team, which I
                led for my final two years with the company.</p>
