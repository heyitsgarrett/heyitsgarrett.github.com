        <p>
            I've spent a good chunk of my life working within the nooks and crannies of software engineering, business development, product design, and user experience. After doing many of those things at <a href="https://mapbox.com">Mapbox</a> and <a href="https://opower.com">Opower</a>, I've settled in as a software engineer at <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a>.

            I live in San Francisco, California with my partner Georgia and our cat, <a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsgarrett/status/726666907592478720">Monster</a>. Most of my free time is spent running, an activity that I am <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/185249">addicted to</a>.

            This site is a mishmash of my interests in illustration, photography, and a few side projects from a quieter internet. It was built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bigbitecreative/macy.js">Macy.js</a>. Without these projects, building all of this would have been a real pain in the ass.
