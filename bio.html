            <p>I grew up in rural Maryland, helping raise animals and making cash on the weekends tending to farms nearby.
                The plan was to keep doing this until college, but then I discovered the web.</p>


            <h3>2000</h3>

            <img alt="Virtual Sprockets homepage, 2002" src="/images/bio/virtualsprockets.jpg" class="br2" />


            <p>I got pretty good with Photoshop and started working after school for a web development company, <a
                   href="http://www.virtualsprockets.com/">VirtualSprockets</a>, where I eventually learned to code. We built mailing list
                software and early online web store infrastructure for non-profits like the <a href="https://aclu.org/">ACLU</a>
                and <a href="https://defenders.org">Defenders of Wildlife</a>. In 2003, the company was acquired by <a
                   href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kintera">Kintera</a>, which was bought five years later by <a
                   href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blackbaud">Blackbaud</a>. There's just one fish left in
                the end, I suppose.</p>


            <h3>2005</h3>



            <img alt="The Envelope Collective" src="/images/projects/envelope-collective/EnvelopeCollective-Cover.jpg" class="br2">




            <p>I created <a href="/projects/envelope-collective">The Envelope Collective</a> with <a href="http://mrmrs.cc/">Adam Morse</a>
                while we were attending Oberlin College in Ohio. We rented a post office box and invited the
                internet to send us art in the mail, with the promise to scan and share every piece we received. Over two years, we
                received 1,500 submissions from 30 countries and shared them all online. It was even the Yahoo site of the day,
                back when that was a big deal.</p>

            <p>The Oberlin College Art Library's <a href="https://isis2.cc.oberlin.edu/library/art/MailArt/History-MailArt.html">fondly
                    remembers</a> the project:</p>


            <blockquote>
                In 2005 two senior studio majors created "The Envelope Collective," a project that collected and scanned
                decorated envelopes from contributors around the world. Neither artist was aware at the time of the Oberlin
                Library Mail Art Collection, nor of the mail art movement in general.
            </blockquote>



            <h3>2006</h3>

            <img alt="Virginia Square metro" src="/images/bio/virginia.jpg" class="br2" />

            <p>I graduated and got a job working for a defense contractor in Washington, DC. I had a security clearance and did classified
                work.</p>


            <h3>2008</h3>

            <img alt="President Obama visits Opower in 2010" src="/images/bio/obama-opower.jpg" class="br2" />

            <p>Eventually seeking a more mission-oriented project, I joined a tiny company called Positive Energy as its first
                designer and frontend engineer. We sent energy reports to folks showing them how they compared to similar homes
                nearby in an effort to
                reduce overall energy consumption <sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn3-25665" id="fnr3-25665"
                       title="see footnote">1</a></sup>. The plan worked -- the company got bigger, was mercifully renamed to <a
                   href="https://opower.com/">Opower</a>, was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6bgVKSnMs0">visited by the
                    President</a>, went public, and then went less public into the waiting arms of <a
                   href="https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oracle-buys-opower-050216.html">Oracle</a>.</p>


            <h3>2012</h3>


            <div class="gallery">
                <div style="background: black url(/images/projects/doodle-or-die/slide-background.jpg) center center;" class="br2 pa4">
                    <img alt="Doodle or Die logo" src="/images/projects/doodle-or-die/logo.png" height="180px" />

            </div>




            <p>Moonlighting after-hours at Opower, I worked on a game called <a href="/projects/doodle-or-die">Doodle or Die</a> with a few
                other folks
                <sup><a class="footnote" href="#fn4-25665" id="fnr4-25665" title="see footnote">2</a></sup> . The concept is
                probably familiar -- it's like the game of telephone, but with a drawing round every other turn. At its peak, we had over
                3 million players creating millions of drawings a month. It was so much fun to work on this game.</p>


            <p>I also had a few smaller creative projects, <a href="/projects/windoodles">Windoodles</a>, <a
                   href="/projects/loudgif">LOUDGIF</a>, and <a href="/projects/imaginawesome">Imaginawesome</a>. All were cute and
                whimsical, back when the internet was still the right size for those kinds of projects.</p>


            <h3>2013</h3>

            <img alt="The Mapbox DC office, 2014" src="/images/bio/mapbox.jpg" class="br2">

            <p>Seeking smaller company vibes again, I connected with <a href="https://mapbox.com">Mapbox</a> to focus on design and
                engineering, eventually creating and leading the Labs team. I built mobile apps, prototyped maps experiences,
                worked on data visualizations, built a markers API, helped the company fundraise, and eventually moved deeper into
                business development and sales as we expanded the platform.</p>


            <h3>2015</h3>

            <div class="gallery">

            <!--SLACK OFFICE -->


            <p>I joined <a href="https://www.slack.com/">Slack</a> as an engineer, working initially with the newly-created Platform team to
                <a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsgarrett/status/677552114399207424">build and launch</a> the <a href="https://www.slack.com/apps">App
                    Directory</a>. I eventually helped create and grow <a
                   href="https://slack.engineering/the-gradual-design-system-how-we-built-slack-kit/">Slack Kit</a>, Slack's interface
                design system. It's the library of buttons and knobs that live between Slack's code and users' button presses. I
                also shipped <a href="https://twitter.com/heyitsgarrett/status/741390884185350144">bugs</a>, <a
                   href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/1172165133956603904">dark mode</a>, a <a
                   href="https://twitter.com/heyitsgarrett/status/1085690889194823681">company rebrand</a>, and a lot of other code that may
                still be holding a few rectangles together somewhere deep in the app.</p>


            <p>Over time, Slack's Accessibility team was combined with Slack Kit into the Product Systems team, which I lead
                for my final two years with the company.</p>


            <h3>2021</h3>


            <p>I left Slack after six years to build something of my own. The company is called <a
                   href="https://www.wonderful.tools/">Wonderful Tools</a> and I'll share more about what we're building soon. I think it could be pretty cool :)</p>

                        <p>We built Opower's PDF reports using HTML on top of a Java engine. Due to the state of PDF technology at the
                            time, we could only use default HTML for any visual rendering. I built the bar chart comparisons entirely with
                            HTML tables, using nesting and background colors to create the overall effect. It felt like a
                            real heist at the time. <a class="reversefootnote" href="#fnr3-25665"
